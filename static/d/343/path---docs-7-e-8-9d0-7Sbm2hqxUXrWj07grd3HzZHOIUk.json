The\n                  blockchain is replicated among every machine running\n                  Axiom. Storage space there is limited, but it is very\n                  reliable. Account data, like public keys to validate\n                  users, and balances indicating how much cryptocurrency is\n                  owned by each account, is kept on the blockchain.\n\n                  File storage, on the other hand, is not replicated among\n                  every machine running Axiom. Files stored on Axiom will\n                  only be replicated to a few different machines. Only hash\n                  values of file content will be stored on the blockchain.\n\n                  To store any data in Axiom, you'll need to acquire some\n                  cryptocurrency, to pay for storage. To make this easier\n                  during the beta period, we have a faucet set up to give\n                  out a small amount of currency to use for development.\n\n                  To sign up, first\n                  [register your email here](https://axiom.org/newsletter).\n                  Then run this command:\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">axiom signup\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will have to enter a token that was emailed to you, so\nplease use a legitimate email address.</p>\n<p>Once you complete the signup command, you should have\nenough money in your account to pay for the storage used\nin application development.
