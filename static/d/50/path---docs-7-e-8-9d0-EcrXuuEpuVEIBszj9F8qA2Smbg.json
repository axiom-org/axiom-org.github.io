The\nblockchain is replicated among every machine running\nAxiom. Storage space there is limited, but it is very\nreliable. Account data, like public keys to validate\nusers, and balances indicating how much cryptocurrency is\nowned by each account, is kept on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>File storage, on the other hand, is not replicated among\nevery machine running Axiom. Files stored on Axiom will\nonly be replicated to a few different machines. Only hash\nvalues of file content will be stored on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>To store any data in Axiom, you'll need to acquire some\ncryptocurrency, to pay for storage. To make this easier\nduring the beta period, we have a faucet set up to give\nout a small amount of currency to use for development.</p>\n<p>To sign up, first\n<a href=\"https://axiom.org/newsletter\">register your email here</a>.\nThen run this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">axiom signup youremail@example.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will have to enter a token that was emailed to you, so\nplease use a legitimate email address.</p>\n<p>The signup command will log in the CLI and generate a secure\npassphrase for you. Keep this somewhere secure.</p>\n<p>Once you complete the signup command, you should have\nenough money in your account to pay for the storage used\nin application development. To check your account balance,\nrun:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">axiom status\n</code></pre>\n<p>Log in using the passphrase that the <code>signup</code> command generated.\nYou should see output that displays a balance greater than\nzero. Congratulations, you now own some of the Axiom cryptocurrency!</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing the CLI","section":"start"},"html":"<p>There are several different ways to interact with Axiom.\nServers running the Axiom blockchain and hosting Axiom\nfiles interact with each other through the wire protocol.\nApplication code typically interacts with Axiom through\nthe JavaScript Axiom client. During the development\nprocess, the most convenient way to interact with Axiom is\ntypically through the CLI.</p>\n<p>The CLI is tested on OS X and Linux. It might also work in Windows.</p>\n<p>You can install the CLI using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm\">npm</a> or\n<a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">yarn</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g axiom-cli\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn global add axiom-cli\n</code></pre>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a Bucket","section":"start"},"html":"<p>To understand file storage on Axiom, it is helpful to understand\nthe concepts of buckets and hosting providers. An Axiom bucket is similar to\nan Amazon S3 bucket. A bucket can hold many files, and a user can own\nmany buckets. Each bucket has a capacity for how many files it can\nstore. One of your buckets could hold the static content for a web\napplication you are deploying, or it could hold the data for an\napplication you are using, or it could hold any sort of files you\nwould like to keep in decentralized storage.</p>\n<p>Data on the blockchain is replicated among every\nmachine running the blockchain. Data in a bucket is\nonly replicated among a few different hosting providers. This\nmakes it relatively inexpensive to store data in a bucket. With the\ndeveloper faucet, you should have enough to pay for about 100 megabytes\nof bucket storage.</p>\n<p>Let's make a bucket. Pick a unique name like\n\"my-cool-example\". Names are unique, so if you pick this exact one it\nprobably won't work because someone else will have gone through the\nexample.</p>\n<p>First, we have to create a new bucket. Let's pick a size of 1 megabyte\nbecause we're just using this as an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">axiom new-bucket my-cool-example 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see output that looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>created bucket: www:my-cool-example\nallocated bucket to 1 provider\nallocated bucket to 2 providers\nallocated bucket to 3 providers\nallocated bucket to 4 providers\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>www</code> is the application tag for this bucket. It defaults to <code>www</code>\nwhich indicates that these files are intended for web access.</p>\n<p>The <code>new-bucket</code> command will automatically allocate the bucket to a\nfew hosting providers for you. Either the owner of a bucket or the\nhosting provider can deallocate the bucket at any time. As a developer, you\nmight want to reallocate a bucket elsewhere if a hosting provider is providing\na poor service level. As a hosting provider, you might want to\ndeallocate a bucket if you discover that it is hosting content that\nyou don't want to be hosting. Providers are never forced to host\nparticular files.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction","section":"start"},"html":"<p>Axiom is a platform for building decentralized\napplications. It is also a cryptocurrency. If you've used\napplication platforms like Heroku or App Engine before,\nyou'll find parts of this familiar. If you've developed an\napplication using other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum\nbefore, you'll find different parts of this familiar.</p>\n<p>Currently, Axiom primarily targets web applications built\nin JavaScript. If you know how to make a simple website,\nyou'll be able to deploy a simple decentralized site. To\nbuild a more complicated application, you'll probably want\nto be familiar with a JavaScript framework like React or\nVue.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn about the Axiom system is\nto build a simple application on it. The \"Getting Started\"\nsection of this documentation will explain how to get an account set up and how to deploy\na simple static site to Axiom. The \"Building Applications\" section will explain how to build a\nslightly more complicated application.
