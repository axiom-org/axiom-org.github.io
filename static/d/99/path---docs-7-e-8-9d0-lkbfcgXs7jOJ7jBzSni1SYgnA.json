The \"Getting Started\"\nsection of this documentation will explain how to get an account set up, how to deploy\na simple static site to Axiom, and then how to build a\nslightly more complicated application. If you're\ninterested in learning more, the later sections will go\ninto more detail.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Here Is Some Lorem Ipsum","section":"lorem-ipsum"},"html":"<p>Blah blobbity blah</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Here Is Some Morem Ipsum","section":"morem-ipsum"},"html":"<p>Hum diddly hum</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing the CLI","section":"start"},"html":"<p>There are several different ways to interact with Axiom.\nServers running the Axiom blockchain and hosting Axiom\nfiles interact with each other through the wire protocol.\nApplication code typically interacts with Axiom through\nthe JavaScript Axiom client.
