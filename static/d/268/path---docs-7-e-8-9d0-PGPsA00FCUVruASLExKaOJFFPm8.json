To\nbuild a more complicated application, you'll probably want\nto be familiar with a JavaScript framework like React or\nVue.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn about the Axiom system is\nto build a simple application on it. The \"Getting Started\"\nsection of this documentation will explain how to get an account set up, how to deploy\na simple static site to Axiom, and then how to build a\nslightly more complicated application. If you're\ninterested in learning more, the later sections will go\ninto more detail.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Here Is Some Lorem Ipsum","section":"lorem-ipsum"},"html":"<p>Blah blobbity blah</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}
