If you know how to make a simple website,\nyou'll be able to deploy a simple decentralized site. To\nbuild a more complicated application, you'll probably want\nto be familiar with a JavaScript framework like React or\nVue.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn about the Axiom system is\nto build a simple application on it. The \"Getting Started\"\nsection of this documentation will explain how to get an account set up, how to deploy\na simple static site to Axiom, and then how to build a\nslightly more complicated application. If you're\ninterested in learning more, the later sections will go\ninto more detail.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Here Is Some Lorem Ipsum","section":"lorem-ipsum"},"html":"<p>Blah blobbity blah</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Here Is Some Morem Ipsum","section":"morem-ipsum"},"html":"<p>Hum diddly hum</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing the CLI","section":"start"},"html":"<p>There are several different ways to interact with Axiom.\nServers running the Axiom blockchain and hosting Axiom\nfiles interact with each other through the wire protocol.\nApplication code typically interacts with Axiom through\nthe JavaScript Axiom client. During the development\nprocess, the most convenient way to interact with Axiom is\ntypically through the CLI.</p>\n<p>You can install the CLI using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm\">npm</a> or\n<a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">yarn</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g axiom-cli\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn global add axiom-cli\n</code></pre>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Signing Up","section":"start"},"html":"<p>The Axiom system stores data in two different ways. The\nblockchain is replicated among every machine running\nAxiom. Storage space there is limited, but it is very\nreliable. Account data, like public keys to validate\nusers, and balances indicating how much cryptocurrency is\nowned by each account, is kept on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>File storage, on the other hand, is not replicated among\nevery machine running Axiom. Files stored on Axiom will\nonly be replicated to a few different machines. Only hash\nvalues of file content will be stored on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>To store any data in Axiom, you'll need to acquire some\ncryptocurrency, to pay for storage. To make this easier\nduring the beta period, we have a faucet set up to give\nout a small amount of currency to use for development.</p>\n<p>To sign up, first\n<a href=\"https://axiom.org/newsletter\">register your email here</a>.\nThen run this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">axiom signup your_email_address@youremail.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will have to enter a token that was emailed to you, so\nplease use a legitimate email address.</p>\n<p>Once you complete the signup command, you should have\nenough money in your account to pay for the storage used\nin application development. To check your account balance,\nrun:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">axiom status\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should output that displays a balance greater than\nzero. Congratulations, you now own some of the Axiom cryptocurrency!</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}
